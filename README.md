# 🧑‍💻 Let's Started
## 1. Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/<leader-username>/appleClone.git
cd appleClone
```

## 2. Create Your Branch
Each member creates a branch based on their task:
```
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```
Example:
```
git checkout -b header
```
## 3. Work on Your Section
Open index.html, locate your section comment (e.g., <!-- Header navigation -->), and add your HTML, CSS, and JS.

## 4. Stage and Commit
Commit frequently and clearly describe what changed.
```
git add .
git commit -m "Added header navigation section"
```
## 5. Pull and Push
Before pushing, always pull the latest version of main to avoid conflicts.
```
git pull origin main
git push -u origin <your-branch-name>
```

# 🔍Tools Used
- HTML5 — Structure
- CSS3 & Bootstrap — Styling and responsiveness
